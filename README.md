# Hands on Explainable Recommender Systems with Knowledge Graphs

Please note that an upgraded ![framework](https://github.com/giacoballoccu/rep-path-reasoning-recsys) has been presented for the ECIR23 conference and will be used in the following versions of the tutorial. It handles more models and evaluations.
